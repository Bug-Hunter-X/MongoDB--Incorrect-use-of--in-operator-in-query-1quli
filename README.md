# MongoDB Incorrect $in Operator Usage
This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries.  The `$in` operator is intended to match documents where a field's value exists within a specified array. However, using it incorrectly can lead to unexpected results, matching only exact values instead of any value within the array.

## Bug
The provided `bug.js` file shows an incorrect use of the `$in` operator.  It attempts to use the `query` object directly within the `$in` operator, which leads to incorrect matching behavior. 

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct usage. The `$in` operator should be applied to an array of values, not a single object.
